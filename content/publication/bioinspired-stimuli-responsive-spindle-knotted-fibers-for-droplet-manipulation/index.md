abstract: Manipulation of small amounts of liquids is of great importance in
  bio/chemical analysis, environmental engineering, medical diagnostics, etc.
  Novel platforms with systematic maneuverability and expanded applications are
  highly desired. Here, inspired by the directional liquid motion ability of
  natural fibrous materials, we present light-responsive spindle-knotted
  microfibers from piezoelectric microfluidics for droplet manipulation. The
  graphene oxide (GO) and poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) [poly(NIPAM)] components
  endow the fiber with near-infrared (NIR) stimuli-responsiveness. Besides, its
  unique structure enables droplet pinning in the knots of the fiber. During NIR
  irradiation, the fiber can shrink and turn hydrophobic, which resulted in
  directional droplet migration from one knot to another. Based on this
  phenomenon, controllable droplet merging could be initiated under light
  control, and chemical reactions could be carried out on-site. More
  intriguingly, systematic manipulation of droplet pathways was achieved through
  a woven fiber network, by which multi-step reactions could occur orderly.
  These features indicated that the bio-inspired photo-controllable
  spindle-knotted fibers would find vast opportunities in broad applications,
  such as micro-reactors and optofluidic systems.

summary: Inspired by the directional liquid transport phenomenon of spider silks
  and the underlying mechanisms regarding a heterogeneously textured bump
  structure, we present microfluidic-derived stimuli-responsive spindle-knotted
  fibers for droplet manipulation
