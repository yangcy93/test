abstract: Nonspherical particles have attracted increasing interest because of
  their shape anisotropy. However, the current methods to prepare anisotropic
  particles suffer from complex generation processes and limited shape
  diversity. Here, we develop a piezoelectric microfluidic system to generate
  complex flow configurations and fabricate jellyfish-like microparticles. In
  this delicate system, the piezoelectric vibration could evolve a
  jellyfish-like flow configuration in the microchannel and the in situ
  photopolymerization could instantly capture the flow architecture. The sizes
  and morphologies of the particles are precisely controlled by tuning the
  piezoelectric and microfluidic parameters. Furthermore, multi-compartmental
  microparticles with a dual-layer structure are achieved by modifying the
  injecting channel geometry. Moreover, such unique a shape endows the particles
  with flexible motion ability especially when stimuliresponsive materials are
  incorporated. On the basis of that, we demonstrate the capability of the
  jellyfish-like microparticles in highly efficient adsorption of organic
  pollutants under external control. Thus, it is believed that such
  jellyfish-like microparticles are highly versatile in potential  applications
  and the piezoelectricintegrated microfluidic strategy could open an avenue for
  the creation of such anisotropic particles.
